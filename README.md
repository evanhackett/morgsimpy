# Micro-Organism Simulator

This project is just a silly animation of little multi-colored circles moving around the screen and eating each other.

## Revisiting this project in 2020

I wrote this in Feb 2015, so I am pleasantly surprised that it still works with the latest version of pygame. Props to pygame for maintaining backwords compatibility all these years!

To run the program, simply clone the repo and run:

```
python driver.py
```

The only required dependency is pygame. At the time of writing (Dec 2020), run the following to install pygame:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

I found the installation instructions here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
